# 🙋‍♂️ About Me

👋Hi there! I'm **Runmao Yao (姚润茂)**. I am an incoming Research Assistant at **MMLab**, **Nanyang Technological University (NTU)**, supervised by [Prof. Ziwei Liu](https://liuziwei7.github.io/). I received my **Bachelor of Engineering** degree from the **School of Software**, **Tsinghua University**. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Yu-Shen Liu](https://yushen-liu.github.io/) and [Prof. Chen Wang](https://sairlab.org/chenw/), whose guidance has greatly shaped my academic journey.

AirRoom: Objects Matter in Room Reidentification

**Runmao Yao**, Yi Du, Zhuoqun Chen, Haoze Zheng, Chen Wang

IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2025

\[[**arXiv**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.01130)\] \[[**Code**](https://github.com/21yrm/AirRoom)\] \[[**Project Page**](https://sairlab.org/airroom/)\]

In this paper, we introduce AirRoom, an object-aware room ReID pipeline with two novel modules: the Receptive Field Expander and Object-Aware Scoring, which effectively leverage multi-level object-oriented information to overcome viewpoint variations.

SuperPC: A Single Diffusion Model for Point Cloud Completion, Upsampling, Denoising, and Colorization

Yi Du, Zhipeng Zhao, Shaoshu Su, Sharath Golluri, Haoze Zheng, **Runmao Yao**, Chen Wang

IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2025

\[[**arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14558)\] \[[**Code**]()\] \[[**Project Page**](https://sairlab.org/superpc/)\]

In this paper, we propose SuperPC, a novel neural architecture that jointly solves inherent shortcomings in the raw point clouds, including noise, sparsity, incompleteness, and the absence of color.
