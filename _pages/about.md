# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è About Me
üëãHi there! I am an incoming Master's student in **Computer Vision (MSCV)** at the **Robotics Institute**, **Carnegie Mellon University**. Prior to this, I completed my **Bachelor of Engineering** at the **School of Software**, **Tsinghua University**. I am honored to have had the opportunity to collaborate with [Prof. Yu-Shen Liu](https://yushen-liu.github.io/), [Prof. Chen Wang](https://sairlab.org/chenw/), and [Prof. Yi Wu](https://jxwuyi.weebly.com/).

AirRoom: Objects Matter in Room Reidentification

**Runmao Yao**, Yi Du, Zhuoqun Chen, Haoze Zheng, Chen Wang

IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2025

\[[**arXiv**](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2503.01130)\] \[[**Code**](https://github.com/21yrm/AirRoom)\] \[[**Project Page**](https://sairlab.org/airroom/)\]

In this paper, we introduce AirRoom, an object-aware room ReID pipeline with two novel modules: the Receptive Field Expander and Object-Aware Scoring, which effectively leverage multi-level object-oriented information to overcome viewpoint variations.

SuperPC: A Single Diffusion Model for Point Cloud Completion, Upsampling, Denoising, and Colorization

Yi Du, Zhipeng Zhao, Shaoshu Su, Sharath Golluri, Haoze Zheng, **Runmao Yao**, Chen Wang

IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2025

\[[**arXiv**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14558)\] \[[**Code**]()\] \[[**Project Page**](https://sairlab.org/superpc/)\]

In this paper, we propose SuperPC, a novel neural architecture that jointly solves inherent shortcomings in the raw point clouds, including noise, sparsity, incompleteness, and the absence of color.

# üóÇÔ∏è Misc
## üèéÔ∏è Formula 1
I have a deep passion for Formula 1‚Äînot only because of the sleek and futuristic design of the race cars, but also because of the pure thrill that high-speed racing brings me.
- My favorite driver is **Max Verstappen**, the phenomenal Dutch racer. His intense focus and total dedication to racing are truly inspiring‚Äîhis mind is fully immersed in the sport. What resonates with me most is his **tenacious and fiercely competitive driving style**. Especially in the 2025 season, even with Red Bull‚Äôs car being less dominant, Max continues to push the limits, consistently breaking lap records through his **unparalleled driving skills**.
- I‚Äôm also a proud member of the **Tsinghua Racing Association**, a student club dedicated to motorsports. I enjoy the club‚Äôs various activities, such as **watching the Chinese Grand Prix live together** and **going go-karting** with fellow enthusiasts. It‚Äôs a great way to connect with like-minded people and stay close to the racing world.

## üêæ Pets
I genuinely love all kinds of pets‚Äîcats, dogs, birds, fish‚Äîyou name it. But **cats** have always been my number one favorite. Unfortunately, I haven‚Äôt had the chance to own one yet, but I truly hope my dream of having a cat will come true once I‚Äôm in the U.S.!
