# 🗂️ Misc
## 🏎️ Formula 1
I have a deep passion for Formula 1—not only because of the sleek and futuristic design of the race cars, but also because of the pure thrill that high-speed racing brings me.
- My favorite driver is **Max Verstappen**, the phenomenal Dutch racer. His intense focus and total dedication to racing are truly inspiring—his mind is fully immersed in the sport. What resonates with me most is his **tenacious and fiercely competitive driving style**. Especially in the 2025 season, even with Red Bull’s car being less dominant, Max continues to push the limits, consistently breaking lap records through his **unparalleled driving skills**.
- I’m also a proud member of the **Tsinghua Racing Association**, a student club dedicated to motorsports. I enjoy the club’s various activities, such as **watching the Chinese Grand Prix live together** and **going go-karting** with fellow enthusiasts. It’s a great way to connect with like-minded people and stay close to the racing world.

## 🐾 Pets
I genuinely love all kinds of pets—cats, dogs, birds, fish—you name it. But **cats** have always been my number one favorite. Unfortunately, I haven’t had the chance to own one yet, but I truly hope my dream of having a cat will come true once I’m in the U.S.!
